# Results

<!-- Here's some example analysis code: -->

```{r}
#| label: get-data
#| eval: false
# Note the path that we need to use to access our data files when rendering this document
my_data <- read.csv(here::here('src/data/raw_data/my_csv_file.csv'))
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-demo-plot
#| fig-cap: "A plot of random numbers"
plot(rnorm(10))
```

Figure @fig-demo-plot shows how we can have a caption and cross-reference for a plot. Note that figure label and cross-references must both be prefixed with `fig-`

```{r}
#| label: demo-inline-code
#| echo: false
x <- round(pi, 2)
```

Here is an example of inline code `r x` in the middle of a sentence.
