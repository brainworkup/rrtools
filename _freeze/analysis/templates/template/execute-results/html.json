Instead it will insert a very small and white (and, thus, invisible) line followed by a page break.\n\nNow knit this doc, and edit the styles in the resulting docx file. Then rename as 'template' and use this in the yml:\n\n```\noutput:\n  word_document:\n    reference_docx: templates/template.docx\n```\n\nDon't forget line numbers for JAS! Headings are bold, underline, nothing. And Arial Narrow 10pt for tables.\n\nSee here for more information: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html\n",
